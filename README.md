🧪 To-Do List Web App – Manual Testing Project

📋 About
This is a small manual testing project I did on the To-Do List Web App -> https://todolist.james.am/#/
The goal was to practice writing test cases, running tests, and reporting bugs in a simple web app that includes basic task management features.

🧰 Tools Used
Trello – to organize test cases and report bugs

🔗 Trello Board
You can check all the test cases, results, and defect reports here:

✅ What I Tested
Adding, editing, and deleting tasks
Marking tasks as complete or incomplete
Using filters (All, Active, Completed)
Task counter
UI behavior while switching between filters

🐞 Some Bugs Found
The task counter always shows one less than the real number of tasks
When switching between filters in a long list, the view doesn’t scroll to the top automatically
The “mark all as completed” arrow needs three clicks to work correctly

💬 Notes
This project was just for practice to get more comfortable with writing test cases and managing bugs in Trello.
